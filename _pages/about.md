Hello! I’m a high energy particle physics student at McGill University. I am primarily focussed on the decay B to D(*) ell nu, which is a high profile decay due to it’s current contention with the Standard Model of Particle Physics.

Summary
-----
* Ph.D. Research: A decay with missing energy at the Belle II experiment (a B Meson Factory), Tsukuba, Japan
* Masters Research: Dark matter (axion & ALP) detection at the DEAP3600 detector, Sudbury, Canada

Interests:
* The environment and ecology
* Equity, diversity and inclusivity in STEMM
* Outreach & science communication
* Practicing physics & justice
* Teaching & tutoring
