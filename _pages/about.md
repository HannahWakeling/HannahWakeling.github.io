About Me
=====

Hello! I'm a physics Ph.D. student, originally from the U.K. I currently study High Energy Particle Physics at McGill University. I am primarily focussed on the decay B to D(*) tau nu, which is a high profile decay due to it's current contention with the Standard Model of Particle Physics!

Research Interests
-----
* Rare Decays with Missing Energy at Belle II (B Meson Factory), Tsukuba, Japan
* Axion (Dark Matter) Detection at DEAP3600, Sudbury, Canada
* Women in Physics (WiP), LGBTQ+ and Equity, Diversity and Inclusivity in STEMM
* Outreach/Science Communication
* Practicing Physics & Justice
