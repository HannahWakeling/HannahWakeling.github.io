Abstract:
The Belle II detector is a competitive, perhaps unique, environment in which to study rare B decays with missing energy to a sensitivity that would exhibit indirect New Physics effects. From a B-B¯ meson pair that has been produced in the SuperKEKB B-factory, one B meson can be can be fully reconstructed through powerful B-tagging, which in turn provides strong constraints for the other B meson. This is an ideal environment in which rare decays with missing energy can be measured. The possible missing energy decays will be examined with a focus on the decay B→τν, which - with the full Belle II data set (50ab−1) - can be probed at unprecedented precision.
