Something I came across today was the difference between a particle decay _channel_, and a decay _chain_. I don't know about you but I'd never distinguished the difference and, until today, used the words interchangeably, but it turns out there _is_ a difference!

Particle decay channels are what the particle can transform into as it decays.

As an example, think of the famous Higgs particle. This particle can decay into multiple channels, incluing two photons, two Z bosons, or two W bosons.

Particle decay chains are the _sequence_ of decay processes. In other words there are many decay channels in a decay chain.

For example, think of the B meson (that my research focuses on, shameless plug!).
The B meson can decay into hundreds of channels. So let's take just one: a B meson decaying to a D meson, tau lepton and a neutrino. Now, these decay products are often called daughters. The D meson daughter can now decay into other particles, as can the others, creating more daughters, like a family tree. Thisfamily tree is the decay chain!
